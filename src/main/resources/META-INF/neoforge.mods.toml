description="LlamaBlocks is a chaotic, but interesting Minecraft mod I've made using MCreator over the past few years. It has a massive variety of features, with the only real criteria for each being what I thought would be interesting, either to play or code. Its features range from a massive amount of similar building blocks with specific color variants, to single blocks with tons of functionality."
