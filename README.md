# LlamaMod
LlamaMod is a chaotic, but interesting Minecraft mod I've made using [MCreator](https://mcreator.net) over the past few years. It has a massive variety of features, with the only real criteria for each being what I thought would be interesting, either to play or code.

## The Features
LlamaMod has a **ton** of features. These range from a massive amounts of similair building blocks with specific color varients and blocksets, to single blocks with tons of redstone and operator functionality.

### Building Blocks
Their are 2 massive sets of building blocks;
1. The custom colored bricks
2. The large tiles

Both sets come in 19 colors:
- All **16 Vanilia Colors** *(White, Light Gray, Gray, Black, Brown, Red, Orange, Yellow, Lime, Green, Cyan, light Blue, Blue, Purple, Magenta, Pink)*
- "Industrial' variants which are colored simalar to Netherite
- "Cherry" variants which are hot pink
- Teal varients

There are also the Tiles *(Black and White)* and the Ceiling tiles *(Blue and Light Gray)*.

Each color varients of the massive set, alongside each Tile set has the following types of blocks:
- a full block
- a stair
- a slab
- a wall
- a fence
- a fence gate
- a trapdoor
- a pressure plate
- a button

This totals to **360** building blocks as of release [0.45](https://github.com/Omegabird113/llama_mod/releases/tag/0.45)!

### The rest is TBD
