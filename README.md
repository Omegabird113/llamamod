# LlamaMod
LlamaMod is a chaotic, but interesting Minecraft mod I've made using [MCreator](https://mcreator.net) over the past few years. It has a massive variety of features, with the only real criteria for each being what I thought would be interesting, either to play or code.

## The Features
LlamaMod has a **ton** of features. These range from a massive amounts of similair building blocks with specific color varients and blocksets, to single blocks with tons of redstone and operator functionality.

### Building Blocks
Their are 2 massive sets of building blocks;
1. The custom colored bricks
2. The large tiles

Both sets come in 19 colors:
- All **16 Vanilia Colors** *(White, Light Gray, Gray, Black, Brown, Red, Orange, Yellow, Lime, Green, Cyan, light Blue, Blue, Purple, Magenta, Pink)*
- "Industrial' variants which are colored simalar to Netherite
- "Cherry" variants which are hot pink
- Teal varients

There are also the Tiles *(Black and White)* and the Ceiling tiles *(Blue and Light Gray)*.

Each color varients of the massive set, alongside each Tile set has the following types of blocks:
- a full block
- a stair
- a slab
- a wall
- a fence
- a fence gate
- a trapdoor
- a pressure plate
- a button

This totals to **360** building blocks as of release [0.45](https://github.com/Omegabird113/llama_mod/releases/tag/0.45)!

### Bananas, Banana Plants, and Farm Scraps
All of these items are related together.

#### The Banana
The banana is a kinda bad food item, other than that you can eat them very fast. Here are their exact properties:
- a nutrional value of 2 *(it heals 1 meatchop)*
- a saturation of 3.55 *(not very good)*
- it can be eaten in 8 ticks *(You can eat them in 0.4 seconds instead of the typical 1.6 seconds for food)*
- It can be composted with a 32.5% success rate

#### The Banana Plant

This is a naturally spawning plant which works similarly to something like Sugar Cane, but:
- It grows up to 5 blocks high
- It's drops are random and can include Bananas, Banana plants, and Farm Scraps
- It can be bone mealed in vanila Java Edition.
- It can be composted with a 50% success rate

#### Farm Scraps

Farmn are non-plantable items which can be used for the following:
- Placing 4 of them plus one of the following items in crafting table makes 2 of that item:
  - Wheat seeds, carrots, beetroot seeds, melon seeds, potatoes, sugar cane, and bamboo
- Placing 8 of them and a banana plant in a crafting table makes another banana plant
- They can be composted at a 17.5% success rate
- 1 of them can be crafted into 1 brown dye
